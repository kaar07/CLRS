# CLRS

In the spring of 1990, the MIT press published the first edition of *Introduction to Algorithms* which over was better known by the last names of its authors and hence [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). Currently in its fourth edition, the books has gone under several revisions and improvements and simultaneously stood out as one of the standard text books to learn Algorithms.

This repository is a consolidation of attempts made towards mastering of Algorithms (and data structures) by using CLRS as the ground reference. Checkout different branches to know about the contributions made by different people. Hail Bellman-Ford!
