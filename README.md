# CLRS

In the spring of 1990, the MIT press published the first edition of *Introduction to Algorithms* which over time came to be better known by the last names of its authors: [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms). Currently in its fourth edition CLRS is considered as a definitive guide to learn algorithms.

This repository is a consolidation of attempts made towards mastering of Algorithms (and data structures), by using CLRS as the ground reference. Checkout different branches to know about the contributions made by different people.
