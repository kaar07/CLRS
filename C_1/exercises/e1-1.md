## Exercise 1.1-1

**Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.**

- That occurs when I have certain tasks to do, and I sort them based on their importance, then take them one by one from the queue.

- This involves selecting the best route out of many based on the shortest total distance traveled when going from one place to another.
