## Exercise 1.1-4

**How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesperson problems given above similar? How are they different?**


*** Similarity ***

- Both can be modelled using a graph data structure.


** Difference ***

- Shortest-path just finds the shortest path between two points. The travelling salesman problem is finding the shortest path when passing through many vertices.
